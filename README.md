You may clone the framework or download a zip of the framework on this page.
There are working solutions for all of the labs, and example projects, that may be a good reference for building Java programs

* Each lab folder has a number and a name, to remind you of what the lab was about.
* The Labs folder is an empty space to do your work.
* You can always copy the solution of a previous lab as the starting point for a new lab.

## Running the Solutions

All of the Java-based solutions are Maven projects.
Import them into an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse as a Maven project, let the IDE install the Maven dependenices, and the launch the project.
