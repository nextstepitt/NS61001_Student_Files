# NS61001 Java-based Testing with Selenium - Student Files

### Revision History

June 19th, 2020

## Introduction 
This project contains the lab framework for the Java-based Testing with Selenium class.
You may clone the framework or download a zip of the framework on this page.
There are working solutions for all of the labs, and example projects, that may be a good reference for building Java programs
with with solid unit, integration, system, quality assurance, and acceptance tests even if you are not interested in the course.

Do the rapidly changing landscape of software development, web, and mobile applications this material is updated frequently.
Feel free update your copy whenever you want to.

## License

The lab framework code is licensed under the MIT license. The corresponding courseware and software dependencies are not. You may use and modify all or part of it as you choose, as long as attribution to the source is provided per the license. See the details in the [license file](./LICENSE.md) or at the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Class Pre-work

This course depends on basic Java programming skills.
If you are an experienced object-oriented programmer (C++, C#, etc) but feel weak with Java, here are a few sources
that you can use to prep for the class:

|Source|Description|
|---|---|
|https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm|A written overview of the Java language and syntax, a quick read if you are an experienced programmer.|
|https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java|A fairly involved tutorial with coding work, about 25 hours. You must register for an account.|

## Class Setup

If you are taking the class online, you may want to consider using dual
monitors or working in an environment with a large wall screen to follow what the instructor demonstrates.

The software setup for the course is involved, so comprehensive instructions have been moved to the [NS61001_Setup.md](./NS61001_Setup.md) document.

## Student Files Folder Layout

Clone, or download a zip file, of this repository (NS61001_Student_Files) from GitHub:

```
NS61001_Student_Files
└── Examples
│    └── 01_Selenium
│    └── 02_Java
│    └── ...
│ 
└── Labs
│    .gitignore
│ 
└── Resources
│    └── 01_Selenium
│    └── 02_Java
│    └── ...
│ 
└── Solutions
     └── 01_Selenium
     └── 02_Java
     └── ...
```

* We recommend that you put the content under ~/Student_Files, where ~ is your home directory.
* If you download a zip file GitHub will name the root folder *NS61001_Student_Files-master*, if you want to you can remove the *-master*.
* Each lab folder has a number and a name, to remind you of what the lab was about.
* The Labs folder is an empty space to do your work.
* Generally you can always copy the solution of the previous lab as the starting point for a lab.

## Running the Solutions

All of the Java-based solutions are Maven projects.
Import them into an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse as a Maven project,
let the IDE install the Maven dependencies, and the launch the project.
